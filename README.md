- 👋 Hi, I’m Gelin Eguinosa (a.k.a @eguinosa)
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Python, Ruby, Swift, C++, C, Java, Objective-C, and every other fun language out there. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science at the University of Havana, in Cuba.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I have to figure this one out. I guess you can just do a pull request or something.
